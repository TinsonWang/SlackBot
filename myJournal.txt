> Added slash command '/message-count': Returns the user's current number of messages sent to the channel
> Set up endpoint for /message-count

> Added some text command placeholders: !weather, !joke, !messagecount, !help, !tasktest
> !tasktest prints a differently formatted (using Markdown) automated message with an altered icon and name
> Formatted a text file of jokes and responses (Referenced from: https://github.com/wesbos/dad-jokes)
> Ran into a synchronous issue: Sometimes the response to the joke gets sent before the joke?
