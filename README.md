# SlackBot - 4900/4910 Independent Study Proposal

Proposed Work
---
At a high-level, this independent study will create a Slack app for Gryph Slack that behaves like a bucket bot. The Slack app will be interactive and respond to certain commands or prompts given by users. To start, the project will involve eliciting the users of Gryph Slack for use cases and aim to implement the given use cases. One goal is to be able to build a knowledge base and answer questions using that knowledge base (ex. a FAQ engine). Additionally, the Slack app will include functionality from the following list: 
-	Casual levels of conversation (jokes, facts, weather information)
-	Simple text adventure
-	Filter and replace select words to create unusual or funny scenarios
-	Answering SQL database queries 
-	In-text language translation
-	Perform REST queries from in-text
-	Tracking statistics such as activity 
-	Leverage machine learning into some features

Personal Learning Outcomes
---
1.	I want to explore webhooks and REST APIs to create something meaningful. 
2.	I want to learn and practice effective techniques for user experience design
3.	I want to learn techniques for parsing user input and be able to identify the best response

Milestones
---
- Milestone 1 (Learning Outcome 1): A demonstration and code review of the webhooks and REST APIs used to date. This milestone will focus on examining and evaluating how the student incorporated RESTful services and webhooks into the bot.  
- Milestone 2 (Learning Outcome 2): Provide a report that evaluates and describes the different kind of user experience design techniques that were used. This milestone will focus on comparing and reflecting the different techniques the student tried and how those worked for their project.
- Milestone 3 (Learning Outcome 3): Demonstrate the capabilities of the most effective technique for parsing user input. The demonstration should include some quantitative measure (performance times, accuracy, user satisfaction, precision, recall) to identify which technique is most effective. 
- Milestone 4: Final report, includes student reflections and full documentation of the bot.
